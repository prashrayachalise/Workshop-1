My name is Prashraya Chalise, and I am 21 years old. I am currently studying at Herald College, Kathmandu, Naxal, where I am focused on gaining knowledge and developing my skills. I am passionate about learning new things and exploring different areas that interest me. I enjoy engaging in activities that help me grow both personally and professionally, and I value honesty, hard work, and dedication in everything I do. In my free time, I like to read, listen to music, and spend time with friends. I am naturally curious and always eager to ask questions and understand the world better. I believe in continuous learning and self-improvement, and I strive to prepare myself for future opportunities. Overall, I aim to make the most of every experience and use it to grow into a well-rounded individual.
